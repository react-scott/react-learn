## Q/A

Ask me any question on [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com) - my username is `artemij`.

#### I get `SyntaxError: .../app.js: Unexpected token` when I run `gulp` command. What should I do?

This is due to some breaking changes made in `babelify` version 7. The book uses `babelify` version __6__ - if you choose to use version 6 as well then please [do the following](https://github.com/fedosejev/react-essentials/blob/master/updates.md#chapter-1-page-14).

If you choose to use `babelify` version __7__, then please see [this comment](https://github.com/fedosejev/react-essentials/issues/21#issuecomment-160316774).

#### Can I have ES6 version of Snapterest?

Yes! [Here it is](https://github.com/jmrog/react-essentials-es6-version). Special thanks to [Jason Rogers](https://github.com/jmrog) who converted Snapterest to ES6 syntax!

#### Can I see Snapterest in action?

Yes! http://fedosejev.github.io/react-essentials-project/

#### How to deploy a stand alone React.js application described in the book?

You can [deploy it on GitHub Pages](how-to-deploy.md).

#### Have you seen your book on Reddit?

[Yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/illegaltorrents/comments/3p008z/request_reactjs_essentials_by_artemij_fedosejev/).

#### Can I have another example of using React.js with Flux?
